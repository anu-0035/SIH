Problem Statement Title:

AI-Powered Delivery Post Office Identification System â€œ The wide, evolving delivery network of the Post Office makes it difficult for customers to write the correct pin code on the postal items for delivery. The Post Office also merges Pincodes together to mechanise and streamline delivery in the emerging volume and mix of mail handled at different stages, including the point of delivery. An intelligent solution, powered by AI is needed to meet the dynamic design of the supply chain both for customers as well as operators within India Post.

Description 

Background: The Department of Post in India boasts the world's largest postal network, with over 165,000 post offices. Through nearly 19,000 pin codes across the country the postal network manages the delivery of postal items across its network. One common issue is the mismatch between the specified Delivery Post Office name and the area PIN code on mail items, leading to delays and customer dissatisfaction.The delivery network design keeps on evolving as Nodal Delivery Centres and Delivery Hubs are introduced to bring in more efficiency in operations. From the perspective of the customer, the challenge is two fold: (a) to know the correct Pin Code, which is itself a challeng; (b) the dynamic nature of operations inside with merged pin codes etc for all or certain categories of mail is also a challenge. Though the customer does not need to bother about (b), the internal system of India Post needs to take care of both issues (a) and (b) for efficient and correct delivery at all times. Description: Postal services are essential for various government, financial, educational, corporate, and public entities, both in urban and rural areas. Despite the widespread use of postal services, inaccurate addressing persists, hampering efficient delivery. Each mail item must clearly indicate the recipient's Delivery Post Office name and area Pin Code.

However, inconsistencies in this information often result in misrouted mail, with approximately 5% of articles handled daily at distribution hubs containing incorrect Pin Codes. Even if correct Pincodes are provided as per information available with the customer, there is a mismatch in the internal operations as the constant upgradation of delivery network with Nodal Delivery Centres with merged pincodes etc makes it too dynamic for internal operators to keep pace with the changes. This leads to mistakes, delays and wasteful movement of mail pieces in the system. Expected Solution: An AI-based scanning solution is proposed to identify the correct delivery location for mail items with unclear or mismatched addresses. This system will utilize advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze and interpret address information, determining the appropriate Delivery Post Office based on available data. By automating the identification process, this solution aims to improve last-mile delivery efficiency, reducing delays and enhancing customer satisfaction. Having taken care of the first problem, the system is also expected to align with internal operational databases for clubbing and mapping of different pincodes for delivery purpose and thereby suggest the right destination for dispatch and delivery of the articles.
